This is my fork of the starter kit for the [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flavours-of-physics) on [lepton number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton_number) violation.

First submission
----------------
Follow the instructions [First submission (python)](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/flavours-of-physics-start/wiki/First-submission-(python)) to prepare your first solution

More complex models
-------------------
Follow [TMVA training, Boosting to uniformity](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/flavours-of-physics-start/wiki/TMVA-training,-Boosting-to-uniformity) to play with another machine learning library or to use 'flatness-oriented' classifiers

ROOT Submission 
----------------
We have prepared c code to run TMVA in ROOT to produce submission. Follow the instructions [First submission using root (c++)](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/flavours-of-physics-start/wiki/First-submission-(root,-ะก))
